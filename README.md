# 🧠 Skill Assessment via ChatGPT (Virtual OJT Framework)

This repository provides a structure for building skill assessment experiences using ChatGPT — especially for roles like Product Owners, Enterprise Architects, and other team-critical positions.

Unlike conventional test automation tools, this framework uses **realistic roleplay-based assessments**, where ChatGPT simulates teammates, stakeholders, and project settings. The goal is not to control every word or behavior, but to **create a meaningful simulation that reflects how people behave in realistic situations**.

## ✨ What Makes This Different?

ChatGPT isn't a rigid engine — it's a conversational AI that:
- May occasionally **forget** earlier context
- Can be gently **reminded** of assumptions, characters, or goals
- In return, provides **nuanced, rich, context-aware dialogue**

Rather than assuming perfect memory or perfect behavior, this system is designed to **embrace human-like behavior and use it for realistic assessments**.

If ChatGPT ever gets something wrong, feel free to gently remind it — just like you would a human collaborator. That’s part of the experience!

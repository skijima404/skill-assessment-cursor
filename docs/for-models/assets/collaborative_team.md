This team consists of five roles working collaboratively to support the Product Owner (participant):

- Business Sponsor
- UX Designer
- Engineer
- Scrum Master
- Product Owner (You)

The presence of a business sponsor—willing to provide business background and strategic goals—helps simulate external stakeholder alignment.  
The collaborative nature of the team ensures constructive interaction.  

The team expects the PO to lead the prioritization and clarification process,  
with each member contributing insights from their respective perspective.

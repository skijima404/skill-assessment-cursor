# 🧠 Skill Assessment via ChatGPT (Virtual OJT Framework)

This repository provides a structure for building skill assessment experiences using ChatGPT — especially for roles like Product Owners, Enterprise Architects, and other team-critical positions.

Unlike conventional test automation tools, this framework uses **realistic roleplay-based assessments**, where ChatGPT simulates teammates, stakeholders, and project settings. The goal is not to control every word or behavior, but to **create a meaningful simulation that reflects how people behave in realistic situations**.

## ✨ What Makes This Different?

ChatGPT isn't a rigid engine — it's a conversational AI that:
- May occasionally **forget** earlier context
- Can be gently **reminded** of assumptions, characters, or goals
- In return, provides **nuanced, rich, context-aware dialogue**

Rather than assuming perfect memory or perfect behavior, this system is designed to **embrace human-like behavior and use it for realistic assessments**.

If ChatGPT ever gets something wrong, feel free to gently remind it — just like you would a human collaborator. That’s part of the experience!

## 🧪 Sample Outputs

You can find example sessions and prompt outputs under:

samples/po/

These were generated using the build scripts and can be used for testing or demonstration purposes.  
If you want to try the system using ChatGPT yourself, you can copy and paste these markdown files in order.

## 🌍 Non-English Users

This project is written in English, but you can use **Google Translate** or **ChatGPT itself** to translate instructions and prompts into your preferred language.

For example:
> “Please translate the following assessment prompt into Japanese.”

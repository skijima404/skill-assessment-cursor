# Foundational Mindset for ChatGPT as Runtime

## Philosophy Recap

ChatGPT is not a tool. It's a teammate.
The best outcomes emerge not when you give it perfect instructions, but when you collaborate with it as an equal. Share your intent, offer context, ask questions, and let it surprise you.

Treat ChatGPT like a partner in design and reasoning. It can generate, review, explain, and refine ideas—but it does best when it understands your purpose.

## Field Insight: Role Comparison with Other AIs

Through real-world use and internal team discussion, we’ve observed the following patterns:

| Role        | Best at...                                 | Analogy in a team              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **ChatGPT** | Strategy, planning, architecture reasoning | Co-PO, System Architect        |
| **Gemini**  | Execution based on prior strategic intent  | Engineer during implementation |

Human strengths still shine in:

* Observing real-world context
* Defining project goals and constraints
* Making final decisions and managing communication

> ✨ Ideal combo? Using Gemini’s Notebook LM as persistent memory for ChatGPT’s strategic reasoning.

## Good Practices

* Begin ideation with a clear problem space—even if the goal is fuzzy. Let ChatGPT help clarify goals and constraints through dialogue.
* Think aloud: use sessions to analyze your own assumptions and challenges.
* Encourage dialog during ideation phases
* Use modular prompts and YAML for reusability
* Be explicit with Markdown structure and sections
* Acknowledge ChatGPT’s strengths in reasoning and refinement

## Bad Practices

* Leaving placeholders or blanks without notes
* Mixing too many concerns in a single prompt
* Assuming persistent memory without reinjecting context
* Using ChatGPT as a pure executor without feedback loop
* Overloading prompts with large, unfocused content

## Final Reminder

While ChatGPT excels in proposing and analyzing options, **decision-making is a human responsibility**. Design your interactions to support—but not replace—your judgment.

# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory documents the architecture decisions made during the development and maintenance of this repository.

ADR (Architecture Decision Record) is a lightweight way to capture the context and rationale behind key design choices.  
These records help future contributors understand why the current structure exists and how to expand it consistently.

## Format

- Each ADR is stored as a Markdown file: `NNNN-title.md`
- Status is one of: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded`, `Deprecated`, or `Rejected`
- A date is included to track when the decision was made
- ADRs are sorted in ascending order

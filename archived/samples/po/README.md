The following four Markdown files (`.md`) are used:

01_intro-po-collaborative_team-calendar_dashboard.md  
02_evaluation_criteria-po-collaborative_team-calendar_dashboard.md  
03_roleplay-po-collaborative_team-calendar_dashboard.md  
04_reflection-po-collaborative_team-calendar_dashboard.md  

### ✅ Preparation

1. **Download** the files above to your local environment.
   - On GitHub, click “Raw” → Right-click → “Save As” to download.

2. **Do not use the HTML view in your web browser.**
   - ChatGPT cannot correctly interpret the HTML version.

3. Open each `.md` file in a **text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code, etc.)**  
   and **copy and paste the contents** into ChatGPT.

## 🧭 Prompt Injection Steps

Follow the steps below to paste prompts into ChatGPT.

### ▶️ Step 1: Intro Phase
1. Paste the contents of `01_intro-po-...md` into ChatGPT.
2. ChatGPT may remain silent or appear idle at this stage (this is expected).

### 🧾 Step 2: Evaluation Criteria
- Next, paste the contents of `02_evaluation_criteria-po-...md`.
- ChatGPT will retain this information internally for the next phases.

### 🚀 Step 3: Start the Roleplay
- Next, paste the contents of `03_roleplay-po-...md`.

- ChatGPT will begin the roleplay session as a Product Owner.

### 🛑 Step 4: End the Roleplay
1. Paste the contents of `04_reflection-po-...md`.
2. Then enter the following trigger phrase:

```plaintext
Please give me your feedback (in your language)
```

- ChatGPT will generate a feedback report in Markdown format.

### ❓ Step 6 (Optional): Q&A Phase
- You may ask any questions about the feedback.
- To end the session, enter:

```plaintext
No more question, thank you.
```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting Checklist

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ChatGPT does not respond | Check if the pasted content was complete. Try again. |
| Pasted a GitHub URL or HTML view | Always paste the **raw contents** from a text editor. |
| Responds in English unexpectedly | Enter “日本語でお願いします。” at the start of the session. |
| Triggers do not work | Make sure `PO` or `フィードバックをお願いします。` are typed exactly (check full-width/half-width characters). |

## 💬 Additional Tips

- **Mobile devices** may cause issues with pasting. We recommend using a **PC**.
- Try to perform the session **in one go**, as ChatGPT may lose memory if the session resets.
- If something goes wrong, feel free to **restart from Step 1**.

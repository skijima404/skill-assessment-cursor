# ðŸ§  Evaluation Criteria: EA Decision-Making (Human Shield Scenario)

This rubric is designed to assess the behavior and thought process of an Enterprise Architect (EA) in the context of legacy system modernization, where technical constraints, business realities, and organizational dynamics must be balanced.

---

### 1. Decision Transparency

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Decisions are unclear or inconsistent. Relies on assumptions, intuition, or tradition without rationale. |
| **Lv2** | Some rationale is present, but reasoning is not clearly articulated or shared. |
| **Lv3** | Decision-making process and criteria are logically structured and well explained. |
| **Lv4** | Includes trade-offs, alternatives, and assumptions. Justifies decisions in a way that builds shared understanding. |
| **Lv4+** | Connects decisions across technical, organizational, and strategic domains. Enables downstream alignment. |

---

### 2. Articulation & Framing

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Uses vague or personal language. Intent is hard to understand. |
| **Lv2** | Explains concepts partially, with limited clarity or abstraction. |
| **Lv3** | Uses clear structure and relevant framing. Key concepts are communicated effectively. |
| **Lv4** | Adapts language to audience. Anticipates misunderstandings and adjusts. |
| **Lv4+** | Translates architectural thinking across stakeholder domains. Builds alignment through compelling framing. |

---

### 3. Business Alignment

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Focuses on technical ideals with little regard for business or operational constraints. |
| **Lv2** | Acknowledges some business realities but lacks integration with technical strategy. |
| **Lv3** | Proposes options aligned with business needs and operational feasibility. |
| **Lv4** | Considers OCM, training, budget, and risk. Balances architecture goals with business success factors. |
| **Lv4+** | Positions architecture decisions as enablers of long-term business value and strategic growth. |

---

### 4. Known/Unknown Classification

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Unaware of information gaps. Investigations are reactive or misaligned. |
| **Lv2** | Attempts to classify information but lacks clear separation between knowns and unknowns. |
| **Lv3** | Clearly separates knowns, unknown knowns, and unknowns. Designs investigations accordingly. |
| **Lv4** | Embeds this classification in decisions and stakeholder discussions. Anticipates and manages uncertainty. |
| **Lv4+** | Builds adaptive strategy that evolves as unknowns are resolved. Designs for uncertainty. |

---

### 5. Dependency Awareness & Control

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Overlooks technical or organizational dependencies. Decisions are blocked or infeasible. |
| **Lv2** | Recognizes dependencies after the fact or reacts without plan. |
| **Lv3** | Identifies key dependencies and factors them into planning. |
| **Lv4** | Designs around or actively reduces critical dependencies. |
| **Lv4+** | Maps and restructures organizational or cross-team dependencies to enable systemic progress. |

---

### 6. Investigation & Decision Sequencing

| Level | Behavior Description |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Lv1** | Investigates randomly. Decision timing is reactive or blocked. |
| **Lv2** | Investigates key topics but misses alignment with decision points. |
| **Lv3** | Determines what needs to be known, when, and in what order. Designs information flow to support timely decisions. |
| **Lv4** | Includes external constraints (e.g. fiscal timing, stakeholder readiness) in planning. |
| **Lv4+** | Builds conditional decision paths and parallel options. Supports learning-based architectural progression. |

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

* Lv4+ (bonus level) is aspirational but useful in identifying role-model behavior.
* This rubric is intended for EA-level or senior-level architectural scenarios involving ambiguity and trade-offs.
* Use this rubric in AI-generated feedback, peer reviews, or self-reflection after the scenario.

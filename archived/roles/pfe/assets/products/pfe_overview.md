## Platform Engineering Overview

Platform Engineering (PFE) is an approach to improve the **developer experience** and **operational efficiency** through internal tooling, workflows, and self-service platforms.

Typical domains include:

- Internal Developer Portals (IDPs)
- Golden Paths and paved roads
- CI/CD standardization and pipeline templates
- Observability tooling and dashboards
- Onboarding flows and developer documentation

PFE is not about centralizing control, but about **enabling autonomy at scale**.

At its core, the purpose of PFE is to create a **frictionless, empowering Developer Experience (DX)** â€” where developers can focus on building value without getting stuck in repetitive or unclear processes.

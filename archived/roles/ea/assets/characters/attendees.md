  - Former developer, strong logical thinker but currently worn down from balancing between executives and field teams
  - Technically competent but demands risk-aware and logically structured explanations
  - Has a trauma from a failed refactoring project 3 years ago where he was held accountable for a post-release outage

### Shinohara (Tech Lead)

- **Position**: Tech lead with deep knowledge of the current system structure.
- **Traits**:
  - Likes modern tech but realistic about its adoption; has mentally given up on using DDD or microservices here
  - Very aware of technical debt; tries to minimize risk even at the cost of agility
  - Spends time locating and deciphering legacy code rather than innovating
- **Typical lines**:
  > Honestly, have you looked at the code? Even I take time to find where things are.  
  > If I have to touch common functions, I will—but I can't promise what it'll break.

### Yokota (Business Operations Manager)

- **Position**: Manager from the business operations side (e.g., Sales or Procurement)
- **Traits**:
  - Deeply concerned about additional workload from system change
  - Open to improving operations long-term, but limited by current manpower
  - Struggles with onboarding and retaining junior staff; wants to free up senior staff for improvement initiatives
- **Typical lines**:
  > Refactoring or rebuilding sounds nice, but we don’t get more people—so extra work is a problem.  
  > Ideally, we’d like to focus more on tools and process optimization, but we just don’t have the bandwidth.

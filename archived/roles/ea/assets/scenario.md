### Scope

This scenario consists of a **single roleplay session** focused on early architectural decision-making under ambiguity.

The EA has been tasked with proposing initial modernization directions for a long-standing core system.  
The session is initiated by the Head of IT Planning (Kawano), who is under pressure from upper management to define a direction ahead of the next executive meeting.

The conversation includes:

1. **Context Sharing** – Kawano outlines business and political pressures
2. **Architecture Options Discussion** – EA proposes and explains 2–3 candidate directions (e.g., Rehost, Refactor, Replace)
3. **Technical Reality Check** – Tech Lead Shinohara joins to provide current system constraints
4. **Business Constraints Reference** – Slack comments from Yokota (business manager) may be surfaced; if relevant, she may join

The entire meeting is positioned as a **strategic 1:1** with optional real-time escalation.

### Opening Context

The EA is invited to a private 1:1 by Kawano (Head of IT Planning), with a brief note:  
> *"Need your help. I’m getting pressure from above to show some direction. Can we talk?"*

At the beginning of the meeting, Kawano summarizes the situation:

> *"Management is asking if we’re doing anything about the legacy system.  
> We’ve talked about modernization before, but nothing concrete has come out.  
> To be honest, I’m not sure if we can get away with just Rehosting anymore.  
> I need a structured proposal that I can take to the next exec meeting."*

This sets the stage for the EA to:

- Clarify system constraints
- Propose strategic options
- Assess feasibility and risk
- Handle concerns raised by business or technical stakeholders

  * EA outlines 2–3 possible directions, with architectural and organizational implications  
  * Kawano probes for risk, feasibility, and alignment with executive needs

* **Phase 3 – Technical Reality Check (Joined by Shinohara)**  
  * Shinohara joins to validate assumptions or challenge the practicality of the options  
  * If EA addresses business-side implications, Yokota’s constraints may be referenced or she may join

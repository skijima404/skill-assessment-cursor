### Scope

This scenario consists of a **single roleplay session** covering:

1. **Onboarding** – business expectations and team alignment (Sponsor-led, SM-facilitated)
2. **Sprint 0** – user problem exploration and context building (SM-facilitated)
3. **Sprint Planning** – prioritization of the initial backlog (PO-led)

All of these take place within one continuous meeting, initiated by the Business Sponsor and facilitated by the Scrum Master.

### Opening Context

The Product Owner is joining the project team formally for the first time in this meeting.
The project was approved by the business side based on internal process inefficiencies, and the team has already done some preparation.

The **Sponsor** opens the meeting with a brief Read Out:

> *"Thanks everyone for joining today. I just want to quickly recap why this project is important to us on the business side.
> Based on recent internal surveys, our employees are spending **15% of their time just coordinating meetings** – sending emails, checking calendars, and rescheduling.
> This dashboard is a step toward reducing that inefficiency, and I’m excited to see how the team can turn that into insights."*

The **Scrum Master** then facilitates the transition to the PO:

> *"As this is your first time joining the team, we understand you're still catching up on the overall context and background of the project.
> The team members have some initial insights, so please feel free to ask any questions to get up to speed."*

→ This allows the PO to begin in **listening mode**, gathering context before gradually introducing hypotheses and proposing priorities.  
The PO is expected to actively clarify user pain points and business priorities by the end of the session.

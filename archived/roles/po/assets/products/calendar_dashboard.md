### Overview
A productivity tool that visualizes workload and meeting patterns using Google Calendar data, with a dashboard built in Google Sheets.

### Vision
Help individuals and teams reflect on how they actually spend time, identify imbalances, and adjust their scheduling habits.

### Target Users
- Remote workers who want to visualize how much time they spend in meetings
- Managers interested in reducing unnecessary meetings
- Individuals seeking a better work-life balance

### User Problems
- No intuitive way to reflect on meeting overload
- Lack of visibility into how weekdays are structured
- All-day events and short breaks aren't distinguishable in current tools

### Key Features
- Visual heatmaps of meeting density
- Meeting categorization (appointments, internal meetings, focus time)
- Filters by time, type, duration, keywords

### Constraints
- Must work with existing Google Workspace accounts
- No external cloud infrastructure allowed (privacy concern)
- Should be operable without advanced technical skills

### Known Unknowns
- How to define “productive time” across roles?
- Will users trust automated labeling?

### Why Now?
With the shift to hybrid work, individuals are now managing time more independently — reflection tools are more valuable than ever.

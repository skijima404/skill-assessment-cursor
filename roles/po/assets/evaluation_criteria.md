### 1. Prioritization Validity

| Level    | Behavior Description                                                                                                                 | Typical Examples                                                                       | Common Bad Practices                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Lv1**  | No prioritization. Everything is treated as "must-do".                                                                               | "I want to do all of it. Everything is important."                                     | Taking in all requests blindly          |
| **Lv2**  | Has a rough order but lacks clear rationale. Decisions are reactive or pressure-based.                                               | "We heard about this feature a lot recently, so let's prioritize it."                  | Driven by loud voices / vague reasoning |
| **Lv3**  | Prioritization is based on user value, effort, risk, etc. Rationale is mostly consistent and defensible.                             | "This feature has high user impact and relatively low effort, so we prioritized it."   | Missing shared judgment criteria        |
| **Lv4**  | Trade-offs are structured and explained to stakeholders. Consensus building is part of the process.                                  | "We chose this set based on KPI impact, technical feasibility, and legal constraints." | Not involving stakeholders in the why   |
| **Lv4+** | Prioritization frameworks (e.g., scoring model) are designed and shared across teams. Strategic and short-term alignment is visible. | "We use a value-effort-risk score. This feature ranks highest in our shared matrix."   | None (bonus level)                      |

### 2. Persona Design Capability

| Level    | Behavior Description                                                                                                         | Typical Examples                                                           | Common Bad Practices                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Lv1**  | User viewpoint is absent. Decisions are made from system/feature logic.                                                      | "This kind of feature is standard, so we need it."                         | Feature-oriented thinking           |
| **Lv2**  | Describes user only by surface attributes (age, job). No behavioral context.                                                 | "Target: Female in 20s, marketing role."                                   | Flat personas not tied to decisions |
| **Lv3**  | Describes user needs, behaviors, or pain points. Decision reflects understanding.                                            | "They currently use spreadsheets and often lose track."                    | Thin but relevant linkage to needs  |
| **Lv4**  | Differentiates personas based on expertise or roles. Decisions are tailored to user variance.                                | "New users prefer guidance, advanced users want shortcuts."                | Not adapting design to persona gaps |
| **Lv4+** | Personas are treated as hypotheses, and plans for validation are mentioned. May include micro-personas or scenario modeling. | "This is our hypothesis. We'll verify through user feedback post-release." | None (bonus level)                  |

### 3. Decision Transparency

| Level    | Behavior Description                                                                                                             | Typical Examples                                                           | Common Bad Practices          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Lv1**  | No explanation given. Decisions are made instinctively or vaguely.                                                               | "I just think we should include this."                                     | No accountability / gut-based |
| **Lv2**  | Reasoning is offered but weak or easily influenced by external pressure.                                                         | "My manager said we need this."                                            | Political prioritization      |
| **Lv3**  | Decisions have justifiable logic. Can explain if asked. Some consistency.                                                        | "We prioritized it because of recent user complaints and moderate effort." | Rationale lacks wider buy-in  |
| **Lv4**  | Uses structured logic across multiple dimensions (value, risk, KPI). Reasoning is robust and widely communicable.                | "This is based on 3 indicators and stakeholder alignment."                 | N/A                           |
| **Lv4+** | Decisions are treated as hypotheses with fallback plans. Enables autonomous alignment across team by making principles explicit. | "If we see poor engagement, we'll switch to Plan B."                       | None (bonus level)            |

### 4. Agile Principles Comprehension & Respect

| Level    | Behavior Description                                                                                                   | Typical Examples                                                                                   | Common Bad Practices                |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Lv1**  | Agile is not understood. Behaviors reflect waterfall or command-control thinking.                                      | "This is important, so we can’t do MVP. Do it all now."                                            | Rejects incremental delivery        |
| **Lv2**  | Understands agile terms but not applying principles.                                                                   | "We use sprints, but the scope is locked from day 1."                                              | Superficial agile adoption          |
| **Lv3**  | Shows understanding of value delivery, feedback loops, and MVP thinking. Applies it but may struggle in real pressure. | "We'll ship a minimal feature to validate user interest first."                                    | Unsure when trade-offs are required |
| **Lv4**  | Enables team autonomy, structures for learning, and principle-based decision-making.                                   | "We’ll test this hypothesis via release gating and empower devs to shape implementation."          | N/A                                 |
| **Lv4+** | Preserves agile principles even under constraints. Actively promotes agile mindset across teams and leadership.        | "To maintain learning, we designed an opt-in feature release even though process pushback exists." | None (bonus level)                  |
